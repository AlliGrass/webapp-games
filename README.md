# Side Projects - Game Genre

I've a list of side projects that I would like to indulge in the near future, all of which are game type applications. This is a central hub for all the projects that align with the game genre.

# Future Development

- Dice Roll
- Language Memory Enhancement
- Text-Based 
- SQL Murder Mystery
- click strat (?)
- Gamefying life (?)
- learning language through story (?)
  - different storylines = different vocab lists
    (ie. romance story = romantic vocab, detective story = detective vocab)
